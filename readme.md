We have built an innovative, groundbreaking keyboard that looks like a keyboard but is actually a keyboard and not a keyboard.

**About**

We always thought traditional keyboards are too boring. We also thought it was funny how electronic pianos and the tools we use to type share a name. So we decided to cross these two, and create this ultimate design! You can only type a choice of 7 letters at a time, as our keyboard only has one octave. Can you make do with only the keys provided to you by the original keyboard - the piano?

**Bill of Materials**

- 1x Orpheus Pico or other RP2040 microcontroller with the same pinout
- 14x Cherry MX style keyswitches
- At least 2m of wire, to connect all components together
- 3d printed keycaps:
    - 2x leftwhitekey.stl
    - 2x rightwhitekey.stl
    - 3x smallwhitekey.stl
    - 5x blackkey.stl
- 2x Regular XDA Cherry MX keycaps - for the octave switching switches
- Cardboard and tools, like hot glue, to create case out of cardboard
- 1x 40mm 8 ohm 2 watt speaker
- 1x MAX98357A speaker amplifier
- 1x Micro SD card reader module
